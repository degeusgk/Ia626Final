Question to be answered:
How much misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic is being shared on social media?

I am interested in trying to determine how much misinformation is being spread on social media. I have heard the spread of misinformation described as an "infodemic". The misinformation being shared is harmful to the spread of the disease itself. I am looking to pull data from Reddit, which has a very well moderated caronavirus subreddit. I'd like to compare this to data pulled from Twitter, which tends to have a different userbase (including the president) and often hosts official correspondance from organizations like the CDC and WHO. I think it would be interesting to see what percentage of posts regarding COVID-19 contain factual information and what percentage perpetuate misinformation.
